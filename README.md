## The Project:



## Installation Instructions:

This project was created on VSCode, using a Windows machine. I had downloaded Python from the extensions and ensured my environment was able to install using 'pip' commands.

To use all features within these files, you will need to install to run the following:

- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import missingno as msno
- import numpy as np
- import pandas as pd
- import plotly.express as px
- import statsmodels.api as sm

You may need to install the programmes to your environment, which is likely as easy as typing 'pip install numpy' into your terminal, depending on your OS.
